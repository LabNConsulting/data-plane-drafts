    <section title="Introduction" anchor="sec_intro">
      <t>
        Deterministic Networking (DetNet) is a service that can be offered by a network to DetNet flows.
        DetNet provides these flows extremely low packet loss rates and assured maximum end-to-end
        delivery latency.  General background and concepts of DetNet can
        be found in the DetNet Architecture <xref target="RFC8655"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        <xref target="RFC8939"/> specifies the DetNet data plane operation for IP
        hosts and routers that provide DetNet service to IP encapsulated
        data.  This document focuses on the scenario where DetNet IP nodes
		are interconnected by a TSN sub-network.
      </t>
      <t>
        The DetNet Architecture decomposes the DetNet related data plane
        functions into two sub-layers: a service sub-layer and a forwarding
        sub-layer.  The service sub-layer is used to provide DetNet service
        protection and reordering. The forwarding sub-layer is used to
        provides congestion protection (low loss, assured latency, and
        limited reordering). As described in <xref target="RFC8939"/> 
		no DetNet specific headers are added to
        support DetNet IP flows, only the forwarding sub-layer functions are
        supported inside the DetNet domain. Service
        protection can be provided on a per sub-network
        basis as shown here for the IEEE802.1 TSN sub-network scenario.

<section title="DetNet IP Data Plane Overview" anchor="sec_dt_dp">
      <t>
        <xref target="RFC8939"/> describes how IP is used by DetNet 
		nodes, i.e., hosts and routers, to identify DetNet flows and provide a 
		DetNet service. From a data plane perspective, an end-to-end IP model
        is followed.  DetNet uses "6-tuple" based flow identification, where 
		"6-tuple" refers to information carried in IP and higher layer protocol
        headers. 
      </t>
      <t>
        DetNet flow aggregation may be enabled via the use of
        wildcards, masks, prefixes and ranges. IP tunnels may also be
        used to support flow aggregation. In these cases, it is
        expected that DetNet aware intermediate nodes will provide
        DetNet service assurance on the aggregate through resource
        allocation and congestion control mechanisms.
      </t>
	  <t>
        Congestion protection, latency control and the resource allocation 
		(queuing, policing, shaping) are supported using the underlying link 
		/ sub-net specific mechanisms.  Service protections (packet
        replication and packet elimination functions) are not provided at
		the IP DetNet layer end-to-end due the lack of a unified end-to-end 
		sequencing information that would be available for intermediate nodes.  
		However, such service protection can be provided on a per underlying 
		L2 link and sub-network basis.
	  </t>
      <t>
	    DetNet routers ensure that DetNet service requirements are met per hop 
		by allocating local resources, both receive and transmit, and by mapping 
		the service requirements of each flow to appropriate sub-network 
		mechanisms.  Such mappings are sub-network technology specific.  
		DetNet nodes interconnected by a TSN sub-network are the primary focus 
		of this document. 
		The mapping of DetNet IP flows to TSN streams and TSN protection 
		mechanisms are covered in <xref target="mapping-tsn"/>.

      <t>
        The Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) Task Group of the IEEE 802.1
        Working Group have defined (and are defining) a number of
        amendments to <xref target="IEEE8021Q">IEEE 802.1Q</xref> that
        provide zero congestion loss and bounded latency in bridged
        networks. Furthermore, <xref target="IEEE8021CB">IEEE
        802.1CB</xref> defines frame replication and elimination
        functions for reliability that should prove both compatible with
        and useful to DetNet networks.  All these functions have to
        identify flows that require TSN treatment.  
	  </t>
      <t>
        TSN capabilities of the TSN sub-network are made available for IP
        (DetNet) flows via the protocol interworking function desribed in Annex C.5 of
        <xref target="IEEE8021CB">IEEE 802.1CB</xref>. For example,
        applied on the TSN edge port it can convert an ingress unicast 
		IP (DetNet) flow to use a specific Layer-2 multicast destination 
		MAC address and a VLAN, in order to direct the packet through a 
		specific path inside the bridged network. 
		A similar interworking function pair at the 
		other end of the TSN sub-network would restore the packet to its 
		original Layer-2 destination MAC address and VLAN.
      </t>
      <t>
        Placement of TSN functions depends on the TSN capabilities of
        nodes. IP (DetNet) Nodes may or may not support TSN functions. For
        a given TSN Stream (i.e., a mapped DetNet flow) an IP (DetNet) node is
        treated as a Talker or a Listener inside the TSN sub-network.
      </t>

          <section title="Functions for DetNet Flow to TSN Stream Mapping">
            <t>
              Mapping of a DetNet IP flow to a TSN Stream is provided via 
			  the combination of a passive and an active stream identification 
			  function that operate at the frame level (Layer-2). The passive stream
			  identification function is used to catch the 6-tuple of a DetNet
			  IP flow and the active stream identification function is used to
			  modify the Ethernet header according to the ID of the mapped TSN 
			  Stream.  
            </t>
            <t>
			  Clause 6.7 of <xref target="IEEE8021CB">IEEE 802.1CB</xref> defines an IP Stream
			  identification function that can be used as a passive function
			  for IP DetNet flows using UDP or TCP. Clause 6.8 of
			  <xref target="IEEEP8021CBdb">IEEE P802.1CBdb</xref> defines a
			  Mask-and-Match Stream identification function that can be used 
			  as a passive function for any IP DetNet flows.
            </t>
            <t>
			  Clause 6.6 of <xref target="IEEE8021CB">IEEE 802.1CB</xref> defines an
              Active Destination MAC and VLAN Stream identification function,
              what can replace some Ethernet header fields namely (1) the
              destination MAC-address, (2) the VLAN-ID and (3) priority
              parameters with alternate values. Replacement is provided for
              the frame passed down the stack from the upper layers or up the
              stack from the lower layers.
            </t>
            <t>
              Active Destination MAC and VLAN Stream identification can be
              used within a Talker to set flow identity or a Listener to
              recover the original addressing information. It can be used also
              in a TSN bridge that is providing translation as a proxy service
              for an End System. 
            </t>

          <section title="TSN requirements of IP DetNet nodes">
            <t>
              This section covers required behavior of a TSN-aware DetNet node 
			  using a TSN sub-network. The implementation of TSN packet 
			  processing functions must be compliant with the relevant IEEE 802.1 
			  standards.
            </t>
            <t>
              From the TSN sub-network perspective DetNet IP nodes are treated 
			  as Talker or Listener, that may be (1) TSN-unaware or 
			  (2) TSN-aware.
            </t>
            <t>
              In cases of TSN-unaware IP DetNet nodes the TSN relay nodes within
			  the TSN sub-network must modify the Ethernet encapsulation of the 
			  DetNet IP flow (e.g., MAC translation, VLAN-ID setting, Sequence 
			  number addition, etc.) to allow proper TSN specific handling 
			  inside the sub-network.  There are no requirements defined for 
			  TSN-unaware IP DetNet nodes in this document.
            </t>
            <t>
              IP (DetNet) nodes being TSN-aware can be treated as a
              combination of a TSN-unaware Talker/Listener and a TSN-Relay, as
              shown in <xref target="fig_ip_with_tsn"/>.  In such cases the IP
              (DetNet) node must provide the TSN sub-network specific Ethernet
              encapsulation over the link(s) towards the sub-network.

            <list style="symbols">

			Mappings between DetNet and TSN management and control planes are 
			out of scope of the document. Some of the challanges are 
			highligthed below.
        </t>
		<t>
			TSN-aware IP DetNet nodes are member of both the DetNet
			domain and the TSN sub-network.  Within the TSN
			sub-network the TSN-aware IP (DetNet) node has a TSN-aware
			Talker/Listener role, so TSN specific management and
			control plane functionalities must be implemented.  There
			are many similarities in the management plane techniques
			used in DetNet and TSN, but that is not the case for the
			control plane protocols. For example, RSVP-TE and MSRP
			behaves differently. Therefore management and control
			plane design is an important aspect of scenarios, where
			mapping between DetNet and TSN is required.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      In order to use a TSN sub-network between DetNet nodes,
	      DetNet specific information must be converted to TSN
	      sub-network specific ones. DetNet flow ID and flow related
	      parameters/requirements must be converted to a TSN Stream
	      ID and stream related parameters/requirements. Note that,
	      as the TSN sub-network is just a portion of the end-to-end
	      DetNet path (i.e., single hop from IP perspective), some
	      parameters (e.g., delay) may differ significantly. Other
	      parameters (like bandwidth) also may have to be tuned due
	      to the L2 encapsulation used within the TSN sub-network.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      In some case it may be challenging to determine some TSN
	      Stream related information. For example, on a TSN-aware IP
	      (DetNet) node that acts as a Talker, it is quite obvious
	      which DetNet node is the Listener of the mapped TSN stream
	      (i.e., the IP Next-Hop). However it may be not trivial to
	      locate the point/interface where that Listener is
	      connected to the TSN sub-network. Such attributes may
	      require interaction between control and management plane
	      functions and between DetNet and TSN domains.
	    </t>
        <t>
	      Mapping between DetNet flow identifiers and TSN Stream
	      identifiers, if not provided explicitly, can be done by a
	      TSN-aware IP (DetNet) node locally based on information
	      provided for configuration of the TSN Stream
	      identification functions (IP Stream identification, 
		  Mask-and-match Stream identification and active Stream 
		  identification function).
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Triggering the setup/modification of a TSN Stream in the
	      TSN sub-network is an example where management and/or
	      control plane interactions are required between the DetNet
	      and TSN sub-network. TSN-unaware IP (DetNet) nodes make
	      such a triggering even more complicated as they are fully
	      unaware of the sub-network and run independently.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Configuration of TSN specific functions (e.g., FRER)
	      inside the TSN sub-network is a TSN domain specific decision 
		  and may not be visible in the DetNet domain.

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
	  Security considerations for DetNet are described in detail in
	  <xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-security"/>. General security considerations
      are described in <xref target="RFC8655"/>. 
	  DetNet IP data plane specific considerations are summarized in 
	  <xref target="RFC8939"/>. 
	  This section considers exclusively security considerations which are 
	  specific to the DetNet IP over TSN sub-network scenario.
      </t>
      <t>
	  The sub-network between DetNet nodes needs to be subject to appropriate 
	  confidentiality. Additionally, knowledge of what DetNet/TSN services are 
	  provided by a sub-network may supply information that can be used in a 
	  variety of security attacks. The ability to modify information exchanges 
	  between connected DetNet nodes may result in bogus operations. Therefore, 
	  it is important that the interface between DetNet nodes and TSN 
	  sub-network are subject to authorization, authentication, and encryption.
      </t>
      <t>
	  The TSN sub-network operates at Layer-2 so various security mechanisms 
	  defined by IEEE can be used to secure the connection between the DetNet 
	  nodes (e.g., encryption may be provided using MACSec 
	  <xref target="IEEE802.1AE-2018"/>).
