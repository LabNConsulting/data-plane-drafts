 <section title="Introduction" anchor="sec_intro">
  <t>
    Deterministic Networking (DetNet) is a service that can be offered by a
    network to DetNet flows.  DetNet provides these flows with a low packet loss
    rates and assured maximum end-to-end delivery latency.  General background
    and concepts of DetNet can be found in <xref
    target="RFC8655"/>.
  </t>
  <t>
    The DetNet Architecture decomposes the DetNet related data plane
    functions into two sub-layers: a service sub-layer and a forwarding sub-layer.
    The service sub-layer is used to provide DetNet service protection and
    reordering. The forwarding sub-layer is used to provides congestion
    protection (low loss, assured latency, and limited reordering)
    leveraging MPLS Traffic Engineering mechanisms.
  </t>
  <t>
	<xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls"/> specifies the DetNet data plane 
	operation for MPLS-based Packet Switched Network (PSN).  MPLS encapsulated 
	DetNet flows can be carried over network technologies that can provide the 
	DetNet required level of service. This document focuses on the scenario 
	where MPLS (DetNet) nodes are interconnected by a IEEE 802.1 TSN sub-network.

 <section title="DetNet MPLS Data Plane Overview" anchor="sec_dt_dp">
  <t>
	The basic approach defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls"/>
	supports the DetNet service sub-layer based on existing pseudowire (PW) 
	encapsulations and mechanisms, and supports the DetNet forwarding 
	sub-layer based on existing MPLS Traffic Engineering encapsulations 
	and mechanisms. 
  </t>
 <t>
  A node operating on a DetNet flow in the Detnet service sub-layer, i.e. 
  a node processing a DetNet packet which has the S-Label as top of stack uses 
  the local context associated with that S-Label, for example a received 
  F-Label, to determine what local DetNet operation(s) are applied to that 
  packet. An S-Label may be unique when taken from the platform
  label space <xref target="RFC3031"/>, which would enable correct DetNet flow
  identification regardless of which input interface or LSP the packet arrives 
  on. The service sub-layer functions (i.e., PREOF) use a DetNet control word 
  (d-CW).
 </t>
  <t>
    The DetNet MPLS data plane builds on MPLS Traffic Engineering
    encapsulations and mechanisms to provide a forwarding sub-layer that
    is responsible for providing resource allocation and explicit
    routes.  The forwarding sub-layer is supported by one or more
    forwarding labels (F-Labels).

        <xref target="fig_mpls_detnet_part"/> illustrates an extract of a 
        DetNet enabled MPLS network. Edge/relay nodes sit at 
		MPLS LSP boundaries and transit nodes are LSRs. In this figure, two 
		MPLS nodes (the edge node and the transit node) are interconnected by 
		a TSN sub-network.
      </t>
      <t>
        DetNet edge/relay nodes are DetNet service sub-layer
        aware, understand the particular needs of DetNet flows and
        provide both DetNet service and forwarding sub-layer functions.
        They add, remove and process d-CWs, S-Labels and F-labels as
        needed.  MPLS enabled DetNet nodes can enhance the
        reliability of delivery by enabling the replication of packets
        where multiple copies, possibly over multiple paths, are
        forwarded through the DetNet domain.  They can also eliminate
        surplus previously replicated copies of DetNet packets.
		MPLS (DetNet) nodes also include
        DetNet forwarding sub-layer functions, support for notably
        explicit routes, and resources allocation to eliminate (or
        reduce) congestion loss and jitter.
      </t>
      <t>
        DetNet transit nodes reside wholly within a DetNet domain, and
        also provide DetNet forwarding sub-layer functions in accordance
        with the performance required by a DetNet flow carried over an
        LSP. Unlike other DetNet node types, transit nodes provide no
        service sub-layer processing.

         title="DetNet MPLS Operation Over IEEE 802.1 TSN Sub-Networks">
	<t>
		The DetNet WG collaborates with IEEE 802.1 TSN in order to define a 
		common architecture for both Layer 2 and Layer 3, what maintains 
		consistency across diverse networks. Both DetNet MPLS and TSN use
		the same techniques to provide their deterministic service:
		<list style="symbols">
			<t>
				Service protection.
			</t><t>
				Resource allocation.
			</t><t>
				Explicit routes.
			</t>
		</list>
		As described in the DetNet architecture 
		<xref target="RFC8655"/> and also illustrated here 
		in <xref target="fig_mpls_detnet_part"/> a sub-network provides from 
		MPLS perspective a single hop connection between MPLS (DetNet) nodes. 
		Functions used for resource allocation and explicit routes 
		are treated as domain internal functions and does not require function
		interworking across the DetNet MPLS network and the TSN sub-network. 
	</t>
	<t>
		In case of the service protection function due to the similarities of 
		the DetNet PREOF and TSN FRER functions some level of interworking is 
		possible. However, such interworking is out-of-scope in this document 
		and left for further study.
	</t>
    <t>
      <xref target="fig_mpls_detnet_to_tsn"/> illustrates a scenario, where 
	  two MPLS (DetNet) nodes are interconnected by a TSN sub-network. Node-1 
	  is single homed and Node-2 is dual-homed to the TSN sub-network.

	<t>
		The Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) Task Group of the IEEE 802.1 
		Working Group have defined (and are defining) a number of amendments 
		to <xref target="IEEE8021Q">IEEE 802.1Q</xref> that provide zero 
		congestion loss and bounded latency in bridged networks. Furthermore
		<xref target="IEEE8021CB">IEEE 802.1CB</xref> defines frame replication
		and elimination functions for reliability that should prove both 
		compatible with and useful to, DetNet networks. All these functions 
		have to identify flows those require TSN treatment.
    </t>
    <t>
        TSN capabilities of the TSN sub-network are made available for MPLS
        (DetNet) flows via the protocol interworking function defined in Annex C.5 of 
        <xref target="IEEE8021CB">IEEE 802.1CB</xref>. For example,
        applied on the TSN edge port it can convert an ingress unicast 
		MPLS (DetNet) flow to use a specific Layer-2 multicast destination 
		MAC address and a VLAN, in order to direct the packet through a 
		specific path inside the bridged network. 
		A similar interworking function pair at the 
		other end of the TSN sub-network would restore the packet to its 
		original Layer-2 destination MAC address and VLAN.
    </t>
    <t>
        Placement of TSN functions depends on the TSN capabilities of
        nodes. MPLS (DetNet) Nodes may or may not support TSN functions. For
        a given TSN Stream (i.e., DetNet flow) an MPLS (DetNet) node is
        treated as a Talker or a Listener inside the TSN sub-network.
    </t>

          <section title="Functions for DetNet Flow to TSN Stream Mapping">
            <t>
              Mapping of a DetNet MPLS flow to a TSN Stream is provided via 
			  the combination of a passive and an active stream identification 
			  function that operate at the frame level. The passive stream
			  identification function is used to catch the MPLS label(s) of a 
			  DetNet MPLS flow and the active stream identification function 
			  is used to modify the Ethernet header according to the ID of the 
			  mapped TSN Stream.  
            </t>
            <t>
			  Clause 6.8 of <xref target="IEEEP8021CBdb">IEEE P802.1CBdb</xref> defines a
			  Mask-and-Match Stream identification function that can be used 
			  as a passive function for MPLS DetNet flows.
            </t>
            <t>
			  Clause 6.6 of <xref target="IEEE8021CB">IEEE 802.1CB</xref> defines an
              Active Destination MAC and VLAN Stream identification function,
              what can replace some Ethernet header fields namely (1) the
              destination MAC-address, (2) the VLAN-ID and (3) priority
              parameters with alternate values. Replacement is provided for
              the frame passed down the stack from the upper layers or up the
              stack from the lower layers.
            </t>
            <t>
              Active Destination MAC and VLAN Stream identification can be
              used within a Talker to set flow identity or a Listener to
              recover the original addressing information. It can be used also
              in a TSN bridge that is providing translation as a proxy service
              for an End System. 
            </t>

          <section title="TSN requirements of MPLS DetNet nodes">
            <t>
              This section covers required behavior of a TSN-aware MPLS (DetNet)
			  node using a TSN sub-network. The implementation of TSN packet 
			  processing functions MUST be compliant with the relevant IEEE 802.1 
			  standards.
            </t>
            <t>
              From the TSN sub-network perspective MPLS (DetNet) nodes are treated 
			  as Talker or Listener, that may be (1) TSN-unaware or 
			  (2) TSN-aware.
            </t>
            <t>
              In cases of TSN-unaware MPLS DetNet nodes the TSN relay nodes 
			  within the TSN sub-network must modify the Ethernet encapsulation 
			  of the DetNet MPLS flow (e.g., MAC translation, VLAN-ID setting, 
			  Sequence number addition, etc.) to allow proper TSN specific 
			  handling inside the sub-network.  There are no requirements 
			  defined for TSN-unaware MPLS DetNet nodes in this document.
            </t>
            <t>
              MPLS (DetNet) nodes being TSN-aware can be treated as a
              combination of a TSN-unaware Talker/Listener and a TSN-Relay, as
              shown in <xref target="fig_mpls_with_tsn"/>.  In such cases the 
			  MPLS (DetNet) node must provide the TSN sub-network specific 
			  Ethernet encapsulation over the link(s) towards the sub-network.

			required only for TSN-aware MPLS (DetNet) nodes. From the
			Data Plane perspective there is no practical difference
			based on the origin of flow mapping related information
			(management plane or control plane).
        </t>
        <t>
            The following summarizes the set of information that is needed to
            configure DetNet MPLS over TSN:
            <list style="symbols">
			  <t>DetNet MPLS related configuration information according to the 
			     DetNet role of the DetNet MPLS node, as per 
			     <xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls"/>. </t>
			  <t>TSN related configuration information according to the 
			     TSN role of the DetNet MPLS node, as per 
				 <xref target="IEEE8021Q"/>, <xref target="IEEE8021CB"/> and
			     <xref target="IEEEP8021CBdb"/>. </t>
              <t>Mapping between DetNet MPLS flow(s) (label information: 
			  A-labels, S-labels and F-labels as defined in 
			  <xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls"/>) and TSN 
			  Stream(s) (as stream identification information defined in 
			  <xref target="IEEEP8021CBdb"/>).
			  Note, that managed objects for TSN Stream identification can be 
			  found in <xref target="IEEEP8021CBcv"/>.			  
			  </t>
            </list>
            This information MUST be provisioned per DetNet flow.
        </t>
        <t>
			TSN-aware MPLS DetNet nodes are member of both the DetNet
			domain and the TSN sub-network.  Within the TSN
			sub-network the TSN-aware MPLS (DetNet) node has a TSN-aware
			Talker/Listener role, so TSN specific management and
			control plane functionalities must be implemented.  There
			are many similarities in the management plane techniques
			used in DetNet and TSN, but that is not the case for the
			control plane protocols. For example, RSVP-TE and MSRP
			behaves differently. Therefore management and control
			plane design is an important aspect of scenarios, where
			mapping between DetNet and TSN is required.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      In order to use a TSN sub-network between DetNet nodes,
	      DetNet specific information must be converted to TSN
	      sub-network specific ones. DetNet flow ID and flow related
	      parameters/requirements must be converted to a TSN Stream
	      ID and stream related parameters/requirements. Note that,
	      as the TSN sub-network is just a portion of the end2end
	      DetNet path (i.e., single hop from MPLS perspective), some
	      parameters (e.g., delay) may differ significantly. Other
	      parameters (like bandwidth) also may have to be tuned due
	      to the L2 encapsulation used within the TSN sub-network.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      In some case it may be challenging to determine some TSN
	      Stream related information. For example, on a TSN-aware MPLS
	      (DetNet) node that acts as a Talker, it is quite obvious
	      which DetNet node is the Listener of the mapped TSN stream
	      (i.e., the MPLS Next-Hop). However it may be not trivial to
	      locate the point/interface where that Listener is
	      connected to the TSN sub-network. Such attributes may
	      require interaction between control and management plane
	      functions and between DetNet and TSN domains.
	    </t>
        <t>
	      Mapping between DetNet flow identifiers and TSN Stream
	      identifiers, if not provided explicitly, can be done by a
	      TSN-aware MPLS (DetNet) node locally based on information
	      provided for configuration of the TSN Stream
	      identification functions (Mask-and-match Stream identification 
		  and active Stream identification function).
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Triggering the setup/modification of a TSN Stream in the
	      TSN sub-network is an example where management and/or
	      control plane interactions are required between the DetNet
	      and TSN sub-network. TSN-unaware MPLS (DetNet) nodes make
	      such a triggering even more complicated as they are fully
	      unaware of the sub-network and run independently.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Configuration of TSN specific functions (e.g., FRER)
	      inside the TSN sub-network is a TSN domain specific decision 
		  and may not be visible in the DetNet domain. Service protection
		  interworking scenarios are left for further study.

<section title="Security Considerations">
  <t>
	  Security considerations for DetNet are described in detail in
	  <xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-security"/>. General security considerations
      are described in <xref target="RFC8655"/>. 
	  DetNet MPLS data plane specific considerations are summarized in 
	  <xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls"/>. 
	  This section considers exclusively security considerations which are 
	  specific to the DetNet MPLS over TSN sub-network scenario.
      </t>
      <t>
	  The sub-network between DetNet nodes needs to be subject to appropriate 
	  confidentiality. Additionally, knowledge of what DetNet/TSN services are 
	  provided by a sub-network may supply information that can be used in a 
	  variety of security attacks. The ability to modify information exchanges 
	  between connected DetNet nodes may result in bogus operations. Therefore, 
	  it is important that the interface between DetNet nodes and TSN 
	  sub-network are subject to authorization, authentication, and encryption.
      </t>
      <t>
	  The TSN sub-network operates at Layer-2 so various security mechanisms 
	  defined by IEEE can be used to secure the connection between the DetNet 
	  nodes (e.g., encryption may be provided using MACSec 
	  <xref target="IEEE802.1AE-2018"/>).
