      <t>
        Deterministic Networking (DetNet) is a service that can be offered by a network to DetNet flows.
        DetNet provides these flows extremely low packet loss rates and assured maximum end-to-end
        delivery latency.  General background and concepts of DetNet can
        be found in the DetNet Architecture <xref target="RFC8655"/>.
      </t>
<!--      <t>
        This document specifies the DetNet data plane operation for IP
        hosts and routers that provide DetNet service to IP encapsulated
        data.  No DetNet specific encapsulation is defined to support IP
        flows, rather existing IP and higher layer protocol header information is used to support
        flow identification and DetNet service delivery.
      </t>
      <t>
        The DetNet Architecture decomposes the DetNet related data plane
        functions into two sub-layers: a service sub-layer and a forwarding
        sub-layer.  The service sub-layer is used to provide DetNet service
        protection and reordering. The forwarding sub-layer is used to
        provides congestion protection (low loss, assured latency, and
        limited reordering). Since no DetNet specific headers are added to
        support DetNet IP flows, only the forwarding sub-layer functions are
        supported using the DetNet IP defined by this document. Service
        protection can be provided on a per sub-net
        basis using technologies such as MPLS <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls"/> and IEEE802.1 TSN.

        <xref target="fig_ip_detnet"/> illustrates an IP DetNet, with an MPLS based DetNet
        network as a sub-network between the relay nodes.  An IP flow is
        mapped to one or more PWs and MPLS (TE) LSPs.  The end systems
        still originate IP encapsulated traffic, identified as
        DetNet flows.  The relay nodes follow procedures defined in
        <xref target="ip-over-mpls"/> to map each DetNet
        flow to MPLS LSPs. While not shown, relay nodes can provide
        service sub-layer functions such as PREOF using DetNet over MPLS,
        and this is indicated by the solid line for the MPLS
        facing portion of the Service component. Note that the Transit
        node is MPLS (TE) LSP aware and performs switching based on MPLS
        labels, and need not have any specific knowledge of the DetNet
        service or the corresponding DetNet flow identification. See

    <section anchor="ip-over-mpls" title="IP over DetNet MPLS">
      <t>
        This section defines how IP encapsulated flows are carried over
        a DetNet MPLS data plane as defined in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls"/>.  Since both Non-DetNet and
        DetNet IP packet are identical on the wire, this section is
        applicable to any node that supports IP over DetNet MPLS, and
        this section refers to both cases as DetNet IP over DetNet MPLS.
      </t>

      <section title="IP Over DetNet MPLS Data Plane Scenarios"
               anchor="sec_ip_mpls_dt_dp_scen">
        <t>
          An example use of DetNet IP over DetNet MPLS is presented here.
        </t>
        <t>
          <xref target="fig_ip_detnet"/> illustrates IP DetNet
          enabled End Systems (hosts) connected to DetNet (DN) enabled
          IP networks, operating over a DetNet aware MPLS network.
          In this Figure we have a case where the Relay nodes act as
          T-PEs and sit at the boundary of the MPLS
          domain since the non-MPLS domain is DetNet aware.  This case
          is very similar to the DetNet MPLS Network Figure 2 in <xref
                  target="I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls"/>.  However, in  <xref
                  target="I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls"/>  Figure 2, the T-PEs are located at the
         end system and MPLS spans the whole DetNet service.

          The primary difference in this document is that the Relay nodes are at the edges of the
          MPLS domain and therefore function as T-PEs, and that MPLS service
          sub-layer functions are not provided over the DetNet IP
          network.  The transit node functions shown above are identical
          to those described in <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls"/>.
        </t>

        <t>
          <xref target="fig_ip_pw_detnet"/> illustrates how relay nodes
          can provide service protection over an MPLS domain.  In this
          case, CE1 and CE2 are IP DetNet end systems which are
          interconnected via a MPLS domain such as described in <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls"/>. Note that R1 and R3
          sit at the edges of an MPLS domain and therefore are similar
          to T-PEs, while R2 sits in the middle of the domain and is
          therefore similar to an S-PE.

          <xref target="fig_ip_detnet"/> illustrates DetNet
          enabled End Systems connected to DetNet (DN) enabled
          MPLS network.  A similar situation occurs when
          end systems are not DetNet aware.  In this case, edge nodes sit at
          the boundary of the MPLS domain since it is also a DetNet domain
          boundary.  The edge nodes provide DetNet service proxies for the
          end applications by initiating and terminating DetNet service
          for the application's IP flows.  While the node types differ,
          there is essentially no difference in data plane processing
          between relay and edges.  There are likely to be differences
          in controller plane operation, particularly when distributed
          control plane protocols are used.
        </t>

        <t>
          It is still possible to provide DetNet service protection for
          non-DetNet aware end systems. This case is basically the
          same as <xref target="fig_ip_pw_detnet"/>, with the exception
          that CE1 and CE2 are non-DetNet aware end systems and R1 and R3
          become edge nodes.

		is identified based on IP, and next level protocol, header information.
        Section 4.4. (Aggregation Considerations) of <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-detnet-ip"/> defines the ways in which aggregation is
        supported through the use of prefixes, wildcards, lists, and port
        ranges.  Collectively, this results in the fairly straightforward
        procedures defined in the next section.
      </t>
      <t>
        As shown in <xref target="fig_ip_pw_detnet"/>, DetNet relay nodes
        are responsible for the mapping of a DetNet flow, at the service
        sub-layer, from the IP to MPLS DetNet data planes and back
        again. Their related DetNet IP over DetNet MPLS data plane
        operation is comprised of two sets of procedures: the mapping of
        flow identifiers, and ensuring proper traffic treatment.
      </t>
      <t>
      Mapping of IP to DetNet MPLS is similar for DetNet IP flows and IP flows.
      The six-tuple of IP is mapped to the S-Label in both cases.
      The various fields may be mapped or ignored when going from IP to MPLS.

        <t>
          A DetNet relay node (ingress T-PE) that sends a DetNet IP flow over a DetNet MPLS network
          MUST map a DetNet IP flow, as identified in <xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-ip"/> into a single MPLS DetNet flow and MUST
          process it in accordance to the procedures defined in
          <xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls"/>.  PRF MAY be
          supported at the MPLS level for DetNet IP flows sent over an DetNet MPLS network.
          Aggregation MAY be supported as defined in <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls"/> Section 4.4. Aggregation
          considerations in <xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-ip"/> MAY be used to
          identify an individual DetNet IP flow. The provisioning of the
          mapping of DetNet IP flows to DetNet MPLS flows MUST
          be supported via configuration, e.g., via the controller plane.
        </t>
        <t>
          A DetNet relay node (egress T-PE) MAY be provisioned to handle packets received via the
          DetNet MPLS data plane as DetNet IP flows.  A single incoming DetNet MPLS
          flow MAY be treated as a single DetNet IP flow, without
          examination of IP headers. Alternatively, packets received via the
          DetNet MPLS data plane MAY follow the normal DetNet IP flow
          identification procedures defined in <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-detnet-ip"/> Section 5.1.
        </t>
        <t>
          An implementation MUST support the provisioning for handling any
          received DetNet MPLS data plane as DetNet IP flows via configuration.
          Note that such configuration MAY include support from PREOF on the
          incoming DetNet MPLS flow.

               title="DetNet IP over DetNet MPLS Traffic Treatment Procedures">
        <t>
          The traffic treatment required for a particular DetNet IP flow is
          provisioned via configuration or the controller plane. When a DetNet
          IP flow is sent over DetNet MPLS, a DetNet relay node MUST ensure that the
          provisioned DetNet IP traffic treatment is provided at the forwarding
          sub-layer as described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls"/>
          Section 5.2. Note that the PRF function MAY be utilized when sending
          IP over MPLS.
        </t>
        <t>
          Traffic treatment for DetNet IP flows received over the DetNet
          MPLS data plane MUST follow Section 5.3 DetNet IP Traffic

        The following summarizes the set of information that is needed to
        support DetNet IP over DetNet MPLS at the MPLS ingress node:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            Each MPLS App-Flow is identified using the IP flow
            identification information as defined in <xref
            target="I-D.ietf-detnet-ip"/>. The information is summarized
            in Section 5.1 of that document, and includes all wildcards,
            port ranges and the ability to ignore specific IP fields.

            The DetNet MPLS service that is to be used to send the
            matching IP traffic.  This matching information is 
             provided in <xref
            target="I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls"/> Section 5.1, and includes
            both service and traffic delivery information.

        The following summarizes the set of information that is needed to
        support DetNet IP over DetNet MPLS at the MPLS egress node:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            S-Label values that are carrying MPLS over IP encapsulated
            traffic.
          </t>
          <t>
            For each S-Label, how the received traffic is to be
            handled. The traffic may be processed according as any other
            DetNet IP traffic as defined in this document or in <xref
            target="I-D.ietf-detnet-ip"/>, or the traffic may be
            directly treated as an MPLS App-flow for additional
            processing according to  <xref
            target="I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls"/>.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        It is the responsibility of the DetNet controller plane to
        properly provision both flow identification information and
        the flow specific resources needed to provided the traffic
        treatment needed to meet each flow's service requirements.
        This applies for aggregated and individual flows.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Security Considerations">
     <t>
       General security
       considerations for DetNet are described in detail in <xref
               target="I-D.ietf-detnet-security"/>.
       DetNet MPLS and DetNet IP security considerations equally apply to this document and
       are described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls"/>
       and <xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-ip"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
       Security aspects which are unique to DetNet are those whose aim is to
       provide the specific quality of service aspects of DetNet, which are
       primarily to deliver data flows with extremely low packet loss rates
       and bounded end-to-end delivery latency.
        </t>
        <t>
        The primary considerations for the data plane are to maintain
        integrity of data and delivery of the associated DetNet service traversing
        the DetNet network.
        Application flows can be protected through whatever means is
        provided by the underlying technology. For example, encryption may be
        used, such as that provided by IPSec <xref target="RFC4301"/> for IP
        flows and/or by an underlying sub-net using MACSec
        <xref target="IEEE802.1AE-2018"/> for IP over Ethernet (Layer-2) flows.
        </t>
        <t>
        From a data plane perspective this document does not add or modify any
        header information.
        </t>
        <t>
        At the management and control level DetNet flows are identified on a
        per-flow basis, which may provide controller plane
        attackers with additional information about the data flows (when
        compared to controller planes that do not include per-flow identification).
        This is an inherent property of DetNet which has security
        implications that should be considered when determining if DetNet is
        a suitable technology for any given use case.
        </t>
        <t>
        To provide uninterrupted availability of the DetNet
        service, provisions can be made against DOS attacks and delay
        attacks. To protect against DOS attacks, excess traffic due to
        malicious or malfunctioning devices can be prevented or mitigated,
        for example through the use of existing mechanism such as policing and shaping applied at
        the input of a DetNet domain. To prevent DetNet packets from
        being delayed by an entity external to a DetNet domain, DetNet
        technology definition can allow for the mitigation of
        Man-In-The-Middle attacks, for example through use of
        authentication and authorization of devices within the DetNet domain.
