        <xref target="fig_dn_ip_mpls_detnet"/> illustrates DetNet
        enabled End Systems (hosts), connected to DetNet (DN) enabled IP
        networks, operating over a DetNet aware MPLS network. In this
        figure, Relay nodes sit at the boundary of the MPLS domain since
        the non-MPLS domain is DetNet aware.  This figure is very
        similar to <xref target="fig_dn_mpls_detnet"/>.  The primary
        difference is that the Relay nodes are at the edges of the MPLS
        domain and therefore function as T-PEs, and that service
        sub-layer functions are not provided over the DetNet IP network.
        There is no difference in transit node function.

      <t>
        <xref target="fig_ip_pw_detnet"/> illustrates how relay nodes
        can provide service protection over the MPLS domain.  In this
        case, CE1 and CE2 are IP DetNet end systems which are
        interconnected via a MPLS domain such as previously shown in
        <xref target="fig_pw_detnet"/>.  Note that R1 and R3 sit at the
        edges of an MPLS domain and therefore are similar to T-PEs,
        while R2 sits in the middle of the domain and is therefore
        similar to an S-PE.

  <t>
   <xref target="fig_tsn_mpls_detnet"/> shows IEEE 802.1 TSN end
   stations operating over a TSN aware DetNet service running over an
   MPLS network.  DetNet Edge Nodes sit at the boundary of a DetNet
   domain. They are responsible for mapping non-DetNet aware L2 traffic to
   DetNet services.  They also support the imposition and disposition of
   the required DetNet encapsulation.  These are functionally similar to
   pseudowire (PW) Terminating Provider Edge (T-PE) nodes which use
   MPLS-TE LSPs.  In this example they understand and support IEEE 802.1
   TSN and are able to map TSN flows into DetNet flows.  The specific of
   this operation are discussed in [TBD-TSN-OVER-DETNET].
  </t>
  <t>
	Native TSN flow and DetNet MPLS flow differ not only by the additional MPLS specific encapsulation, but DetNet MPLS flows have
	on each DetNet node an associated DetNet specific data structure, what defines flow related characteristics and required
	forwarding functions. In this example, edge Nodes provide a
        service proxy function that "associates" the DetNet flows and native flows
	at the edge of the DetNet domain. This ensures that the DN Flow is properly served at the Edge node (and inside the domain).

  <t>
   <xref target="fig_8021_detnet"/> illustrates how DetNet can provide services for IEEE 802.1TSN
   end systems, CE1 and CE2, over a DetNet enabled MPLS network.
   Similar to <xref target="fig_ip_mpls_detnet"/>, the edge nodes, E1 and E2, insert and remove required DetNet data
   plane encapsulation.  The 'X' in the edge nodes and relay node, R1, represent a potential DetNet compound flow
   packet replication and elimination point.  This conceptually parallels L2VPN services, and could
   leverage existing related solutions as discussed below.

     <t>
       [Editor's note: I think the rest of this section belongs in a new

     </t>
     <t>
       This may be done in the DetNet layer, or where the native service
       processing (NSP) <xref target="RFC3985"/> is IEEE 802.1CB <xref
       target="IEEE8021CB"/> capable, the packet replication and
       duplicate elimination MAY entirely be done in the NSP, bypassing
       the DetNet flow encapsulation and logic entirely. This enables
       operating over unmodified implementations and deployments. The
       NSP approach works only between edge nodes and cannot make use of
       relay nodes.
     </t>
     <t>
       The NSP approach is useful end to end tunnel and for for "island
       interconnect" scenarios. However, when there is a need to do
       PREOF in a middle of the network, such plain edge to edge
       operation is not sufficient.
     </t>
     <t>
       The extended forwarder MAY copy the sequencing information from
       the native DetNet packet into the DetNet sequence number field
       and vice versa. If there is no existing sequencing information
       available in the native packet or the forwarder chose not to copy
       it from the native packet, then the extended forwarder MUST
       maintain a sequence number counter for each DetNet flow (indexed
       by the DetNet flow identification).
     </t>


   <section title="Cross-DetNet Flow Resource Aggregation" anchor="Aggregation">
     <t> [Editor's NOTE: Isn't this section the same as "Aggregation at the
     LSP". -- Address as part of aggregation section cleanup.]
     </t>
     <t>
       The ability to aggregate individual flows, and their associated
       resource control, into a larger aggregate is an important technique
       for improving scaling of control in the data, management and
       control planes.  This document identifies the traffic identification
       related aspects of aggregation of DetNet flows.  The resource
       control and management aspects of aggregation (including the
       queuing/shaping/policing implications) will be covered in other
       documents.  The data plane implications of aggregation are
       independent for PW/MPLS and IP encapsulated DetNet flows.
     </t>
     <t>
       DetNet flows forwarded via MPLS can leverage MPLS-TE's existing
       support for hierarchical LSPs (H-LSPs), see <xref
       target="RFC4206"/>.  H-LSPs are typically used to aggregate control
       and resources, they may also be used to provide OAM or protection
       for the aggregated LSPs.  Arbitrary levels of aggregation naturally
       falls out of the definition for hierarchy and the MPLS label stack
       <xref target="RFC3032"/>.  DetNet nodes which support aggregation
       (LSP hierarchy) map one or more LSPs (labels) into and from an
       H-LSP.  Both carried LSPs and H-LSPs may or may not use the TC
       field, i.e., L-LSPs or E-LSPs.  Such nodes will need to ensure that
       traffic from aggregated LSPs are placed (shaped/policed/enqueued)
       onto the H-LSPs in a fashion that ensures the required DetNet
       service is preserved.
     </t>
     <t>
       [NOTE: This needs to be revised:]

       Additional details of the traffic control
       capabilities needed at a DetNet-aware node may be covered in the
       new service descriptions mentioned above or in separate future
       documents.  Management and control plane mechanisms will also need
       to ensure that the service required on the aggregate flow (H-LSP or
       DSCP) are provided, which may include the  discarding or remarking
       mentioned in the previous sections.
     </t>
   </section>

   <section title="Layer 2 Addressing and QoS Considerations">
     <t> [Editor's NOTE: review and simplify this section. Doesn't this
     belong in the TSN section? Alternatively, describe in generic/non
     sub-network technology specific terms.]
     </t>
     <t>
       The Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) Task Group of the IEEE 802.1 Working Group have
       defined (and are defining) a number of amendments to <xref target="IEEE8021Q">IEEE 802.1Q</xref>
       that provide zero congestion loss and bounded latency in bridged networks.
       <xref target="IEEE8021CB">IEEE 802.1CB</xref> defines packet replication and elimination
       functions that should prove both compatible with and useful to, DetNet networks.
       </t><t>
       As is the case for DetNet, a Layer 2 network node such as a bridge may need to
       identify the specific DetNet flow to which a packet belongs in order to provide the
       TSN/DetNet QoS for that packet.  It also will likely need a CoS marking, such as the
       priority field of an IEEE Std 802.1Q VLAN tag, to give the packet proper service.
       </t><t>
       Although the flow identification methods described in <xref target="IEEE8021CB">IEEE 802.1CB</xref>
       are flexible, and in fact, include IP 5-tuple identification methods, the baseline
       TSN standards assume that every Ethernet frame belonging to a TSN stream
       (i.e. DetNet flow) carries a multicast destination MAC address that is unique to that
       flow within the bridged network over which it is carried.  Furthermore,
       <xref target="IEEE8021CB">IEEE 802.1CB</xref> describes three methods by which a packet
       sequence number can be encoded in an Ethernet frame.
       </t><t>
       Ensuring that the proper Ethernet VLAN tag priority and destination MAC address
       are used on a DetNet/TSN packet may require further clarification of the customary
       L2/L3 transformations carried out by routers and edge label switches.  Edge nodes
       may also have to move sequence number fields among Layer 2, PW, and IP encapsulations.

       scope of this document, and the production of a specialist

       Time synchronization is important both from the perspective of
       operating the DetNet network itself and from the perspective of
       transferring time across the network between client applications.
       Some clients may be able to use the DetNet as their provider
       of time and frequency, others may require the DetNet to
       transfer time between a client clock source and a client
       clock user.

       For example, <xref target="RFC8169"/> describes a method of recording
       the packet queuing time in an MPLS LSR on a packet by per packet
       basis and forwarding this information to the egress edge system.
       This allows compensation for any variable packet queuing delay to be
       applied at the packet receiver. Other mechanisms for IP/MPLS networks
       are defined based on IEEE Standard 1588 <xref target="IEEE1588"/>,
       such as ITU-T <xref target="G.8275.1"/> and <xref
       target="G.8275.2"/>.
