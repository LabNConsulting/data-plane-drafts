  <abstract>
   <t>
     This document specifies the MPLS Deterministic Networking data plane
     operation and encapsulation over an IP network. The approach is modeled
     on the operation of MPLS and over UDP/IP packet switched networks.
   </t>
  </abstract>
  </front>

 <middle>
 <section title="Introduction" anchor="sec_intro">
  <t>
    Deterministic Networking (DetNet) is a service that can be offered by a
    network to DetNet flows.  DetNet provides these flows extremely low packet 
	loss rates and assured maximum end-to-end delivery latency.
	General background
    and concepts of DetNet can be found in <xref
    target="RFC8655"/>.
  </t>
<!--  <t>
    The DetNet Architecture decomposes the DetNet related data plane
    functions into two sub-layers: a service sub-layer and a forwarding sub-layer.
    The service sub-layer is used to provide DetNet service protection and
    reordering. The forwarding sub-layer is used to provides congestion
    protection (low loss, assured latency, and limited reordering)
    leveraging MPLS Traffic Engineering mechanisms.
  </t> -->
  <t>
  This document specifies use of the MPLS DetNet encapsulation over an IP network.
  The approach is modeled on the operation of MPLS over
  an IP Packet Switched Network (PSN) <xref target="RFC7510"/>.
  It maps the MPLS data plane encapsulation described in <xref
  target="I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls"/> to the DetNet IP data plane defined in <xref
  target="I-D.ietf-detnet-ip"/>.
 </t>
 <t>
  To carry DetNet MPLS flows with full functionality at the DetNet layer over an IP network, the
  following components are required (these are a subset of the requirements for MPLS encapsulation
  listed in <xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls"/>):
  </t>
  <t>
   <list style="numbers">
    <t>A method for identifying DetNet flows to the processing element.</t>
    <t>A method for carrying the DetNet sequence number.</t>
    <t>A method for distinguishing DetNet OAM packets from DetNet data packets.</t>
    <t>A method for carrying queuing and forwarding indication.</t>
   </list>
  </t>
 <t>
  These requirements are satisfied by the DetNet over MPLS Encapsulation
  described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls"/> and they are partly satisfied
  (i.e., IP flows can be identified however no DetNet sequence number is carried) 
  by the DetNet IP data plane defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-ip"/>
 </t>

                                      IP PSNs">
 <t>
  This document builds on the specification of MPLS over UDP defined
  in <xref target="RFC7510"/>.  It may replace partly or entirely the F-Label(s) used in <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls"/> with UDP and IP headers.  The UDP and
  IP header information is used to identify DetNet flows, including member
  flows, per <xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-ip"/>. The resulting encapsulation
  is shown in  <xref target="IP-encap-dn"/>. There may be zero or more F-label(s)
  between the S-label and the UDP header.
 </t>

 <t>
   Note that this encapsulation works equally well with IPv4, IPv6, and
   IPv6-based Segment Routing <xref target="I-D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header"/>.

    S-Labels, A-Labels (when present), d-CW and zero or more F-Labels are used as defined in <xref
    target="I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls"/> and are not modified by this document.

  </t>
</section>

<section anchor="dp-procs" title="DetNet Data Plane Procedures">
  <t>
    To support outgoing DetNet MPLS over UDP/IP encapsulation, an implementation MUST support the
    provisioning of UDP and IP header information in addition or in place of
        F-Label(s).
    Note, when PRF is performed at the MPLS service sub-layer, there
    will be multiple member flows, and each member flow will require the
    provisioning of their own UDP and IP header information.
	The headers for each outgoing packet MUST be formatted according to 
	the configuration information and as defined in <xref
    target="RFC7510"/>, and the 
	UDP Source Port value MUST be set to uniquely identify the DetNet flow.
	The packet MUST then be handled
    as a DetNet IP packet, per <xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-ip"/>.
    This includes QoS related traffic treatment.
  </t>

  <t>
    To support the receive processing defined in this document, an 
	implementation MUST also support
    the provisioning of received UDP and IP header information.
        The provisioned information MUST be used to
    identify incoming app-flows based on the combination of S-Label and
    incoming encapsulation header information.  Normal receive processing as defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-detnet-mpls"/>, including PEF and POF,
    can then take place.

                 title="Management and Control Information Summary">
          <t>
            The following summarizes the set of information that is needed to
            configure DetNet MPLS over UDP/IP:
            <list style="symbols">
                          <t>Label information (A-labels, S-labels and F-labels) to
                          be mapped to UDP/IP flow. Note that for example, a single
                          S-Label can map to multiple sets of UDP/IP
                          information when PREOF is used.</t>
              <t>IPv4 or IPv6 source address field.</t>
              <t>IPv4 or IPv6 destination address field.</t>
              <t>DSCP Field in either IPv4 Type of Service or IPv6 Traffic Class Fields.</t>
              <t>UDP Source Port. </t>
              <t>UDP Destination Port. </t>
            </list>
            This information MUST be provisioned per DetNet flow via
            configuration, e.g., via the controller <xref target="RFC8655"/> 
			or management plane.
          </t>
          <t>
            It is the responsibility of the DetNet controller plane to
            properly provision both flow identification information and
            the flow specific resources needed to provide the traffic
            treatment needed to meet each flow's service requirements.
            This applies for aggregated and individual flows.
